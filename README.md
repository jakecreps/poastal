**Poastal** is an email OSINT tool that provides valuable information on any email address. With Poastal, you can easily input an email address and it will quickly answer several questions, providing you with crucial information.

## ✨ Features 

- Determine the name of the person who has the email.
- Check if the email is deliverable or not.
- Find out if the email is disposable or not.
- Identify if the email is considered spam.
- Check if the email is registered on popular platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Parler, Rumble, MeWe, Imgur, Adobe, Wordpress, and Duolingo.

## 💻 Usage

Make sure you have the requirements installed.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Navigate to the backend folder and run `poastal.py` to start the Flask app. This points to port:8080.

```python poastal.py```

Open `index.html` in the root directory to use the UI.

Enter an email address and see the results.

Test with `example@gmail.com`.

There's a new GitHub module. 

If you open up `github.py` you'll see a section that asks you to replace it with your own API key.

I hope you find Poastal to be a valuable tool for your OSINT investigations. If you have any feedback or suggestions on how we can improve Poastal, please let me know. I'm always looking for ways to improve this tool to better serve the OSINT community.
